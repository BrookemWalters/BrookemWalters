### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Brooke. I have over a decade of experience in data analysis,  from writing grant proposals for after school programs, to leveraging consumer behavior in advertising campaigns, and more recently studying health population trends in Michigan counties. 

Telling stories with data is my creative outlet and passion. 

...but Iâ€™m new, and this is messy.

### Hi there, I'm BrookeðŸ‘‹
Telling stories with data is my creative outlet and passion. 


##### :star: a little about me :star: 
I have over a decade of experience in data analysis,  from writing grant proposals for after school programs, to leveraging consumer behavior in advertising campaigns, and more recently studying health population trends in Michigan counties. Additionally, I'm both an [Afganistan veteran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom) and an [AmeriCorps VISTA](https://americorps.gov/serve/fit-finder/americorps-vista) alumn.

My current goal is to earn my master's in data science and analytics before my 40th birthday (Nov 2025). 

:see_no_evil: ...Iâ€™m new to coding, and this is messy.

### Hi there, I'm BrookeðŸ‘‹
telling stories with data is my forte


##### :star: a little about me :star: 
I have over a decade of experience in data analysis,  from writing grant proposals for after school programs, to leveraging consumer behavior in advertising campaigns, and more recently studying health population trends in Michigan counties. Additionally, as both a [Afghanistan war](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99227900/178118903-d03b9aae-a486-4575-be2a-a4c9f819ca0e.png) veteran and an [AmeriCorps VISTA](https://americorps.gov/serve/fit-finder/americorps-vista) alumn, I'm a bit of an anomaly. 

My current goal is to earn my master's in data science and analytics before my 40th birthday. 

:see_no_evil: ...Iâ€™m new to coding, and this is messy.
